# About

This folder contains several Python files that were made while following Pluralsight's course [Getting Started with Data Analysis Using Python](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/python-data-analysis-getting-started/table-of-contents).  

Description from the website:

"Data analysis is one of the fastest growing fields, and Python is one of the best tools to solve these problems. In this course, Getting Started with Data Analysis Using Python, you'll learn how to use Python to collect, clean, analyze, and persist data. First, you'll discover techniques including persisting data with csv files, pickle files, and databases, along with the ins and outs of basic SQL and Sqlite command line. Next, you'll delve into data analysis and how to use common data structures, such as lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets. Additionally, you'll learn how to use these structures and apply these skills to widely available stock market data. Finally, you'll explore pygal, a Python library for data visualization. [...]"

# Running the Program

## Requirements
You will need Python3 and pandas. All other libraries are standard with Python. 

**If the file contains `import pandas as pd`**:

Before running the program, navigate to the folder in your command line, and type:

```
pip install pandas
```

## Instructions

1. Download files or clone, save to location of your choice.
2. Navigate to location you saved `stock-market` folder and cd to `python`.
3. In the command line, run the file, likely `python [FILE NAME]`, replacing [FILE NAME] with the name of the file you wish to run. 

**NOTE**
`get_records.py` was made to be an additional exercise to add onto a table created in [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org). Four entries were added in the DB Browser before starting the Python file. Commands were commented out after the file was run and more commands added. It is not recommended to try to run this file.
