# About

This folder contains several notebooks that were made while following Pluralsight's course [Cleaning Data: Python Data Playbook](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/cleaning-data-python-data-playbook/table-of-contents).  

Description from the website:

"At the core of any successful project that involves a real world dataset is a thorough knowledge of **how to clean that dataset from missing, bad, or inaccurate data.** In this course, Cleaning Data: Python Data Playbook, you'll learn how to use pandas to clean a real world dataset. First, you'll learn how to understand, view, and explore the data you have. Next, you'll explore how to access just the data that you want to keep in your dataset. Finally, you'll discover different ways to handle bad and missing data. When you're finished with this course, you'll have a foundational knowledge of cleaning real world datasets with pandas that will help you as you move forward to working on real world data science or machine learning problems."

## Running the Program

### Requirements
This program runs on Jupyter Notebook and uses `pandas` and `requests` libraries. If you have Anaconda installed, you can run a notebook without any further downloads. [Learn more about Anaconda here.](https://docs.anaconda.com) 

If you do not have Anaconda and don't wish to download it, before opening the repo, run from your command line:

```
pip install pandas
pip install jupyter
```

### Instructions

1. Clone or download the repo, save to location of your choice.
2. Open command line and type `jupyter notebook`, or open from start menu.
3. In the notebook console, navigate to the location of the saved file in your computer.
4. Open whichever `.ipynb` you wish to use.
5. Run all the cells.

Recommended for the first time running, go to `Kernel` tab and click `Restart & Run All`.
