# About

This is an in-class exercise from 1/27/2022.

Instructions to class:
1. Find a dataset to work with.
2. With your dataset, try a few examples of querying and selecting data by slicing, masking, or query()
3. Analyze your data; what do you see in it? Anything you find interesting?
4. Calculate some fields with your data like I did above.
5. Try graphing / visualizing your data either with Matplotlib or df.plot()
